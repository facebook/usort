User Guide
==========

The µsort command line interface is the primary method for sorting imports
in your Python modules. Installing µsort can be done via ``pip``:

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ pip install usort

To format one or more files or directories in-place:

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ usort format <path> [<path> ...]

To generate a diff of changes without modifying files:

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ usort diff <path> [<path> ...]

µsort can also be used to validate formatting as part of CI:

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ usort check <path> [<path> ...]


Sorting
-------

µsort follows a few simple steps when sorting imports in a module:

1. Look for all import statements in the module
2. Group these statements into "blocks" of sortable imports
   (See `Import Blocks`_ for details)
3. Reorder import statements within each block
4. Normalize whitespace between imports as needed

When ordering imports within a block, µsort categorizes the imports by source
into four major categories for imports, prioritized following common community
standards:

* :mod:`__future__` imports:
* Standard library modules (from CPython):
* Third-party modules (external imports)
* First-party modules (internal, local, or relative imports)

Within each category, imports are sorted first by "style" of import statement:

* "basic" imports (``import foo``)
* "from" imports (``from foo import bar``)

And lastly, imports of the same style are sorted lexicographically by source
module name, and then by name of element being imported.

Altogether, this will result each block of imports sorted roughly according
to this example, for a module in the namespace :mod:`something`::

    # future imports
    from __future__ import annotations

    # standard library
    import re
    import sys
    from datetime import date, datetime, timedelta
    from pathlib import Path

    # third-party
    import requests
    from attr import dataclasses
    from honesty.api import download_many

    # first-party
    from something import other_function, some_function
    from . import some_module
    from .other_module import some_name, that_thing


Configuration
-------------

µsort shouldn't require configuration for most projects, but offers some basic
options to customize sorting and categorization behaviors.

:file:`pyproject.toml`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The preferred method of configuring µsort is in your project's
:file:`pyproject.toml`, in the ``tool.usort`` table.
When sorting each file, µsort will look for the "nearest" :file:`pyproject.toml`
to the file being sorted, looking upwards until the project root is found, or
until the root of the filesystem is reached.

``[tool.usort]``
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The following options are valid for the main ``tool.usort`` table:

.. attribute:: categories
    :type: List[str]
    :value: ["future", "standard_library", "third_party", "first_party"]

    If given, this list of categories overrides the default list of categories
    that µsort provides. New categories may be added, but any of the default
    categories *not* listed here will be removed.

.. attribute:: default_category
    :type: str
    :value: "third_party"

    The default category to classify any modules that aren't already known by
    µsort as part of the standard library or otherwise listed in the
    ``tool.usort.known`` table.

.. attribute:: side_effect_modules
    :type: List[str]

    An optional list of known modules that have dangerous import-time side
    effects. Any module in this list will create implicit block separators from
    any import statement matching one of these modules.

    See :ref:`side-effect-imports`.

.. attribute:: first_party_detection
    :type: bool
    :value: true

    Whether to run a heuristic to detect the top-level name of the file being sorted,
    and consider that name as first-party.  This heuristic happens after other options
    are loaded, so such names cannot be overridden to another category if this is
    enabled.


``[tool.usort.known]``
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The ``tool.usort.known`` table allows for providing a custom list of known
modules for each category defined by :attr:`categories` above. These modules
should be a list of module names assigned to a property named matching the
category they should be assigned to. If a module is listed under multiple
catergories, the last category it appears in will take precedence.

As an example, this creates a fifth category "numpy", and adds both :mod:`numpy`
and :mod:`pandas` to the known modules list for the "numpy" category, as well
as adding the :mod:`example` module to the "first_party" category:

.. code-block:: toml

    [tool.usort]
    categories = ["future", "standard_library", numpy", "third_party", "first_party"]
    default_category = "third_party"

    [tool.usort.known]
    numpy = ["numpy", "pandas"]
    first_party = ["example"]


Import Blocks
-------------

µsort uses a set of simple heuristics to detect "blocks" of imports, and will
only rearrange imports within these distinct blocks.

Comment Directives
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Comments with special directives create explicit blocks, separated by the line
containing the directives, which will remain unchanged::

    import math

    import important_thing  # usort: skip

    import difflib

Both ``# usort:skip`` and ``# isort:skip`` (with any amount of whitespace),
will trigger this behavior, so existing comments intended for isort will still
work with µsort.

Statements
^^^^^^^^^^

Any non-import statement positioned between imports will create an implicit
block separator. This allows µsort to automatically preserve use of modules
that must happen before other imports, such as filtering warnings or debug
logging::

    import warnings
    warnings.filterwarnings(...)  # <-- implicit block separator

    import noisy_module

    print("in between imports")  # <-- implicit block separator

    import other_module

Shadowed Imports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any import that shadows a previous import with a different source will also cause block
splitting, but the individual blocks can still be sorted.

Same source is fine; these are still sortable::

    import os
    import os.path
    import os

But if they have different sources, then there will be two blocks now.  Note that ``zz``
is part of the second block, because ``foo as os`` ends its block, as the
next-to-the-last import of the name ``os``::

    import foo as os  # <-- first import of "os"; kind of a block separator
    import zz  # <-- caught in the middle
    import os  # <-- second import of "os"

If there are multiple imports shadowed on a line, this gets pretty confusing::

    import m as x
    import n as y
    import p
    import o as z # <-- first import of any of "x", "y", or "z"
    import a  # <-- caught in the middle, this is part of the second block
    import x, y, z  # <-- second import of "x", "y", and "z"

In this particular example, the ``p`` import needs a second invocation of ``usort``
before it ends up in its final position.

Star Imports
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Star imports, which can potentially shadow or be shadowed by any other import,
will also create implicit block separators::

    import foo

    from bar import *  # <-- implicit block separator

    import dog

.. _side-effect-imports:

Side Effect Imports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Writing modules with import-time side effects is a bad practice; any side
effects should ideally wait for a function in that module to be called, like
with :func:`warnings.filterwarnings()`. In these cases, µsort will correctly
find and create a block separator, preventing accidental changes in execution
order when sorting.

However, it's common for testing libraries and entry points to have well-known
side effects when imported, and this can cause trouble with import sorting.
Rather than adding ``# usort:skip`` comments to every occurence, these modules
can be added to the :attr:`side_effect_modules` configuration option:

.. code-block:: toml
    :name: pyproject.toml

    [tool.usort]
    side_effect_modules = ["sir_kibble"]

µsort will then treat any import of these modules as implicit block separators::

    import foo

    from sir_kibble import leash  # <-- implicit block separator

    import dog

This may result in less-obvious sorting results for users unaware of the
context, so it is recommended to use this sparingly. The ``list-imports``
command may be useful for understanding how this affects your source files.


Troubleshooting
---------------

If µsort behavior is unexpected, or you would like to see how µsort detects
blocks in your code, the `list-imports` command may help.

Given the file ``test.py``::

    import warnings
    warnings.filterwarnings(...)

    import foo
    from bar import bar  # usort:skip

    import sys

Running ``list-imports`` will generate the following output:

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ usort list-imports test.py
    test.py 3 blocks:
    body[0:1]
    Formatted:
    [[[
    import warnings
    ]]]
    body[2:3]
    Formatted:
    [[[

    import foo
    ]]]
    body[4:5]
    Formatted:
    [[[

    import sys
    ]]]

Note that imports that are also block separators (like star imports or imports
with ``skip`` directives) will not be listed in the output, because they are
not within the sortable blocks that µsort operates on.

If more details are desired, the ``--debug`` flag will also provide categories
and sorting information for each import:

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ usort list-imports --debug test.py
    test.py 3 blocks:
    body[0:1]
        0 SortableImport(sort_key=SortKey(category_index=1, is_from_import=False, ndots=0), first_module='warnings', first_dotted_import='warnings', imported_names={'warnings'}) (Category.STANDARD_LIBRARY)
    body[2:3]
        0 SortableImport(sort_key=SortKey(category_index=2, is_from_import=False, ndots=0), first_module='foo', first_dotted_import='foo', imported_names={'foo'}) (Category.THIRD_PARTY)
    body[4:5]
        0 SortableImport(sort_key=SortKey(category_index=1, is_from_import=False, ndots=0), first_module='sys', first_dotted_import='sys', imported_names={'sys'}) (Category.STANDARD_LIBRARY)
